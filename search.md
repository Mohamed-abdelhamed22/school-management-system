1. Class:
Reference Type: Classes are reference types, meaning variables of a class type store references to objects in memory (on the heap).
Mutability: Classes are mutable by default, allowing their state to be changed after creation.
Inheritance and Polymorphism: Classes fully support inheritance and polymorphism, enabling the creation of complex object hierarchies and flexible code.
Use Cases: Ideal for complex objects with both state and behavior, when inheritance is required, or when objects need to be passed by reference.
2. Struct:
Value Type: Structs are value types, meaning variables of a struct type directly store the data itself (on the stack or inline within another type).
Lightweight and Performance-Oriented: Designed for small, simple data structures, often used for performance optimization in scenarios where frequent copying of data is acceptable.
Limited Features: Structs have limitations compared to classes, such as not supporting inheritance and having restrictions on default constructors.
Use Cases: Suitable for small, immutable data groups, especially when performance is a critical concern and the overhead of reference types is undesirable.
3. Record:
Data-Centric Types: Records are primarily designed for modeling immutable data, emphasizing value semantics.
Immutability: Records are immutable by default (for record classes), meaning their state cannot be changed after creation. This enhances data integrity and simplifies reasoning about code.
Value-Based Equality: Records automatically provide value-based equality comparison, meaning two record instances are considered equal if all their public properties have the same values.
Synthesized Members: Records automatically generate useful members like ToString(), GetHashCode(), and a with expression for non-destructive mutation.
Record Classes vs. Record Structs: Records can be either reference types (record class) or value types (record struct). Record structs combine the immutability features of records with the performance characteristics of structs.
Use Cases: Excellent for data transfer objects (DTOs), immutable data models, and scenarios where value-based equality and immutability are important.
Summary:
Class: General-purpose, mutable, reference type with full OOP features.
Struct: Lightweight, mutable (by default), value type for small data.
Record: Data-centric, immutable (by default), with value-based equality and synthesized members, available as both reference and value types.
